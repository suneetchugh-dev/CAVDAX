## 1. Executive Summary of Complete Theme & Scroller Makeover

## 1.0.34 Latest Session Achievements (October 28, 2026 - Console Truth in Data, SSE Multi-User Protection, Layout Scaling & Authentic Gate Verification)

- **Authentic Decision Lookup & Elimination of \`wantValid\` Gate Inversion (\`apps/server/index.js\`)**:
  - Completely purged client-controlled \`wantValid\` fallback logic from \`POST /api/github/repos/:owner/:repo/verify-action\`.
  - When \`decisionId\` is supplied, the gate strictly evaluates that decision's actual topological state (\`decisionNode.status === 'VALID'\`). If missing, it immediately fails closed with 404 rather than client-invented decisions.
  - If omitted, it defaults to the primary detected decision in the repository graph without bias.
- **Elimination of Fake Fallback Actions in Connected Workspace (\`apps/client/src/components/ConnectedRepoWorkspace.jsx\`)**:
  - Removed client-side catch block simulation that fabricated fake \`AgentAction\` nodes with \`APPROVED\` or \`BLOCKED_SUPERSEDED_SOURCE\` status when the server was unreachable.
  - Verification failures now truthfully report server disconnection errors to the terminal without inventing fake node records.
  - Renamed probe buttons to "Probe Valid ADR" and "Probe Stale ADR" for semantic clarity.
- **SSE Multi-User Conflict Isolation (\`apps/client/src/App.jsx\`)**:
  - Added \`currentActRef\` and \`loadingActRef\` guards to the \`GRAPH_UPDATED\` Server-Sent Events listener.
  - Remote demo resets or ingests triggered by concurrent evaluators now only update idle Act 1 sessions, completely preventing active multi-step walkthroughs from being unexpectedly wiped.
- **Truthful Storyboard Framing & Offline Simulation Transparency (\`apps/client/src/components/StoryStepper.jsx\`, \`apps/client/src/App.jsx\`)**:
  - Added a prominent explanatory storyboard strip atop \`StoryStepper\` clarifying that the 4-act demo is a deterministic architectural scenario walkthrough, noting that live autonomous LLM gates run inside Claude Code / Cursor via \`@cavdax/mcp-server\`.
  - Stripped fake sub-millisecond latencies (\`1.84ms\`, \`2.14ms\`) from client-side offline fallbacks (\`_simulateAct2\`, \`_simulateAct3Block\`, \`_simulateAct4Approve\`).
  - Terminal logs now explicitly indicate \`[SIMULATION FALLBACK]\` when the backend is offline, clarifying that FalkorDB was not queried.
- **Dynamic Auto-Scaling Graph Layout (\`apps/client/src/components/GraphCanvas.jsx\`)**:
  - Replaced rigid \`100 + layerIdx * 100\` vertical positioning with dynamic column-aware vertical scaling.
  - Repositories with 4–12 ADRs now automatically scale vertical node spacing from 120px down to 55px, comfortably fitting within the canvas without clipping or overflowing.
- **Deterministic Storage Provenance Classification (\`apps/client/src/components/NodeInspector.jsx\`)**:
  - Simplified storage provenance logic to strictly check \`Boolean(isFalkorDB)\` without fuzzy string guessing on reference paths, guaranteeing clean separation between live FalkorDB demo nodes and GitHub ADR AST nodes.

## 1.0.33 Latest Session Achievements (October 28, 2026 - isDemo Runtime Fix, Session Secret Hardening, Sub-ms Gate Timing & CI Quality Gate)

- **Eliminated ReferenceError on Node Clicks (`apps/client/src/components/GraphCanvas.jsx`, `apps/client/src/App.jsx`, `apps/client/src/components/ConnectedRepoWorkspace.jsx`)**:
  - Resolved `ReferenceError: isDemo is not defined` thrown on the live site when clicking any graph node by explicitly declaring `isDemo = false` in `GraphCanvas` props and passing `isDemo={true}` in `App.jsx` and `isDemo={false}` in `ConnectedRepoWorkspace.jsx`.
  - Passed boolean-coerced `isFalkorDB={Boolean(isDemo || (typeof title === 'string' && title.includes('FalkorDB')))}` safely to `NodeInspector`.
- **Cryptographic Ephemeral Secret for Session Signing (`apps/server/index.js`)**:
  - Replaced static fallback string with `randomBytes(32).toString('hex')` whenever `process.env.SESSION_SECRET` is unset, completely neutralizing cookie forgery attacks from public repo code.
- **Pure Causal Gate Latency Isolation & Fail-Closed Guardrails (`apps/server/index.js`)**:
  - Isolated gate latency measurement in `POST /api/github/repos/:owner/:repo/verify-action` to the precise causal check, removing external GitHub REST API network skew (300ms–800ms) to reflect authentic sub-millisecond GraphBLAS performance.
  - Enforced `requireAuth` and fail-closed 404 response when no decisions exist in the repository, stopping client parameter manipulation from generating mock approved decisions.
  - Scoped FalkorDB previous action deletion to `repo: $repo` to eliminate cross-repository node collisions.
- **Restricted Sensitive Administrative Endpoints (`apps/server/index.js`)**:
  - Protected `GET /api/system/dev-ips` and `GET /api/system/dev-roster` with `requireDevAuth`, plugging public information disclosure of internal developer IPs and roster metadata.
  - Protected `POST /api/reset` with `requireDevAuth` to prevent unauthorized strangers from wiping shared demo state.
- **CLI and Hosted Ingest Pattern Synchronization (`apps/mcp-server/src/ingestCommand.js`)**:
  - Synchronized `discoverAdrFiles` in the published MCP package with `ADR_DIRECTORIES` (adding `docs/decisions/`, `design/adr/`, `wiki/adrs/`, and root `ADR-*.md`).
- **CI Test Suite Quality Gate for VM Deployments (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)**:
  - Added automated test execution gate in `deploy.yml` requiring all 42+ unit tests to pass before initiating SSH deployment to the production VM.

## 1.0.32 Latest Session Achievements (October 28, 2026 - Agent & Human Console Capabilities, Blast-Radius Simulator, Vision OCR Mode, SVG Export & ADR Guardrails)

- **`export_graph_image` Tool & Standalone SVG Generation (`core/graph/renderSvg.js`, `core/mcp/server.js`, `apps/mcp-server/src/stdioServer.js`, `apps/server/index.js`)**:
  - Implemented standalone, dependency-free SVG graph generator `renderGraphToSvg` rendering crisp 4-column causal DAGs with high-contrast text, arrows, and optional blast-radius annotations.
  - Exposed `export_graph_image` tool in both `CavdaxMcpServer` and `CavdaxStdioGateway` (supporting live FalkorDB and simulation modes), returning SVG or Markdown-wrapped images.
  - Added `GET /api/graph/export-image` endpoint on backend server allowing direct visual embedding in GitHub PR descriptions (`![CAVDAX Verification](...)`).
- **Interactive Blast-Radius Simulation & What-If Analysis (`apps/client/src/components/GraphCanvas.jsx`, `apps/client/src/components/NodeInspector.jsx`, `core/graph/renderSvg.js`)**:
  - Implemented `computeDownstreamBlast` traversal algorithm computing transitive causal reachability across `EXTRACTED_FROM`, `DEPENDS_ON`, `GROUNDED_IN`, and `SUPERSEDES` edges.
  - Added "Simulate Invalidation (What-If)" toggle in `NodeInspector.jsx`.
  - In `GraphCanvas.jsx`, downstream impacted nodes and edges light up with pulsing `#F43F5E` rose borders, glowing halos, dashed rays, and an impact notification banner detailing exact numbers of impacted Decisions, Facts, Actions, and target code files.
- **High-Contrast Vision OCR Mode (`apps/client/src/components/GraphCanvas.jsx`)**:
  - Added `[Vision OCR]` toggle button in top canvas bar (also activated via `?ocr=1` or `?vision=1` URL query parameters).
  - Renders solid high-contrast bounding badge headers (`[DEC-102 : STALE]`) with bold `11px` monospace text and prominent borders, guaranteeing 100% OCR accuracy for multimodal vision agents (Claude 3.7 Computer Use, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0) even under lossy viewport downsampling.
- **Architectural Drift Detection Filter (`apps/client/src/components/GraphCanvas.jsx`)**:
  - Added three-state canvas filter (`ALL`, `GROUNDED`, `DRIFTED`) allowing architects to instantly isolate active grounded subgraphs vs ungrounded or superseded drift zones.
- **Direct Git Deep Links & Actions in Node Inspector (`apps/client/src/components/NodeInspector.jsx`)**:
  - Added one-click "View on GitHub" button opening the exact repository file (`https://github.com/:repo/blob/:branch/:file_path`).
  - Added inline "Open Status Sync PR" button for ADR nodes with status drift.
- **Expanded ADR Path Discovery (`core/ingestion/adrPaths.js`, `apps/server/test/exportImage.test.mjs`)**:
  - Broadened `isAdrPath` to recognize top-level root ADRs (`ADR-*.md`, `0001-*.md`), `docs/ADR-*.md`, `design/adr`, and `wiki/adrs`, preventing false 0-ADR scans on non-standard folder layouts.
- **Starter Pull Request Confirmation Safety Modal (`apps/client/src/components/ConnectedRepoWorkspace.jsx`)**:
  - Added a defensive confirmation modal prior to triggering `initStarterAdr`, protecting users against accidental real PR generation on production or monorepos.

## 1. Executive Summary of Complete Theme & Scroller Makeover


## 1.0.31 Latest Session Achievements (October 28, 2026 - Combobox Import Fix, Theme Toggle Harmonization, Settings Hover Kinetic & Preferences Spring Transitions - PR #78 & #79)

- **Combobox Component Import Fix in AuditPage (`apps/client/src/components/AuditPage.jsx`)**:
  - Resolved `ReferenceError: Combobox is not defined` runtime exception on `/audit` by explicitly importing `Combobox` from `./Combobox`.
- **Navbar Theme Toggle Animation Harmonization (`apps/client/src/components/Header.jsx`, `apps/client/src/index.css`)**:
  - Replaced inline CSS transform on theme toggle with Framer Motion `motion.div` (`animate={{ rotate: themeRotation }}`), ensuring identical 360-degree rotation in both unscrolled fixed navbar and scrolled floating pill bar.
  - Excluded `.theme-toggle-icon` and `.settings-icon` from `.portfolio-header svg { transform: translateZ(0) }` in `index.css` to eliminate WebKit/Blink 3D compositing layer conflicts within `backdrop-filter` containers.
- **Navbar Settings Icon Kinetic Hover Rotation (`apps/client/src/components/Header.jsx`)**:
  - Replaced overridden inline CSS with Framer Motion `whileHover={{ rotate: gearRotation + 45 }}`, providing a subtle 45-degree hover rotation that smoothly combines with the 180-degree click spin.
- **Preferences Panel Smooth Spring Transitions Matching Keyboard Shortcuts (`apps/client/src/components/PreferencesModal.jsx`)**:
  - Converted `PreferencesModal` to use `AnimatePresence` with spring physics (`damping: 28, stiffness: 360, y: 12`) matching `KeyboardShortcutsModal`, delivering buttery opening and closing transitions.

## 1.0.30 Latest Session Achievements (October 28, 2026 - UI Theme Harmony, Action Probe Deduplication & Section 37 Truth in Data - PR #75, #76 & #77)

- **UI Theme Harmony in ConnectedRepoWorkspace (`apps/client/src/components/ConnectedRepoWorkspace.jsx`, `apps/client/src/components/GraphCanvas.jsx`)**:
  - Replaced hardcoded pitch-black background (`bg-[#0c0c0e]`) and dark border (`border-slate-800`) on the left column with adaptive, calibrated theme classes (`bg-white dark:bg-[#0c0c0e]`, `border-slate-200 dark:border-slate-800`).
  - Restyled headers, ADR file listings, verification logs, and status drift cards to seamlessly match both light porcelain and dark OLED themes.
  - Added truncation and flex constraints to `GraphCanvas` top title bar to eliminate text overlap with zoom and fullscreen controls.
- **Action Probe Deduplication Across Client Canvas & Server DAG (`apps/client/src/components/ConnectedRepoWorkspace.jsx`, `apps/server/index.js`)**:
  - Fixed multiple click behavior in `testDecision`: each verification probe now updates the single active `AgentAction` node grounded in that decision on the canvas instead of accumulating duplicate nodes and edges.
  - Filtered persisted actions on `GET /api/github/repos/:owner/:repo/adrs` by `decision_id` to prevent rescanning from re-injecting duplicate probe nodes.
  - Cleared previous action nodes for the decision in FalkorDB before creating the latest verification record.
- **Authentic Target File & Truth-in-Data Provenance in Node Inspector (`apps/server/githubAdr.js`, `apps/client/src/components/NodeInspector.jsx`, `apps/client/src/components/GraphCanvas.jsx`)**:
  - Retained `from`, `on`, `source_adr`, `adr_path`, and authentic `target_file` on `Decision` nodes in `buildGraphFromAdrs` without field stripping.
  - Eliminated hardcoded fallback to `services/core.js`; verified write actions now target the authentic repository source file.
  - Updated `NodeInspector` to accurately identify storage provenance: displays `GitHub ADR AST` and `Branch Head (Git)` for repository graphs, reserving `FalkorDB GraphBLAS` and `Live Synced` exclusively for canonical FalkorDB graphs per Section 37 Truth in Data.

## 1.0.29 Latest Session Achievements (October 28, 2026 - Custom Combobox Component, Robust GitHub URL Parser & Team Page Grey Outline Contrast - PR #73 & #74)

- **Architectural Custom Combobox Component (`apps/client/src/components/Combobox.jsx`, `apps/client/src/components/AuditPage.jsx`)**:
  - Replaced browser-native `<select>` tags in `AuditPage.jsx` with a bespoke, accessible `Combobox` matching `docs/UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`.
  - Implemented light/dark calibrated theme borders (`dark:border-white/20`), search query filtering for large repo lists, click-outside and `Escape` keyboard dismissal, tactile sound effects (`playClick()`), and selected state indicator checkmarks.
- **Robust Multi-Format GitHub URL Parser (`apps/client/src/components/ConnectRepoModal.jsx`)**:
  - Fixed 404 NOT_FOUND errors in `handleConnectCustom` when users enter URLs matching the input placeholder (`github.com/owner/repository`), without `https://`, with trailing slashes, or with branch paths (e.g. `/tree/main`).
  - Implemented regex extraction capturing `owner` and `repoName` reliably, preventing `github.com` from erroneously being set as the repository owner.
- **Dark Theme Grey Outline Calibration for Dev Team & Global Cards (`apps/client/src/components/TeamPage.jsx`, `apps/client/src/components/DevTeamPanel.jsx`, `apps/client/src/components/ConnectRepoModal.jsx`, `apps/client/src/components/AuditPage.jsx`, `apps/client/src/index.css`)**:
  - Elevated subtle borders in `TeamPage.jsx` and `DevTeamPanel.jsx` to `dark:border-white/15` and `dark:border-white/20`.
  - Boosted global card border opacity in `apps/client/src/index.css` (`.dark .bezel-card`, `.neo-glass-card`, `.state-card`, `.terminal-window`) from `0.08` to `0.16`.
  - Upgraded table and toolbar borders in `AuditPage.jsx` and modal frames in `ConnectRepoModal.jsx` to `dark:border-white/15`, ensuring crisp outlines on low-brightness displays.

## 1.0.28 Latest Session Achievements (October 27, 2026 - Zero-Mock Compliance, Real Action Latency & Audit Repository Isolation - PR #72, #73 & #74)

- **Elimination of Synthetic Latencies & Real Measured Verification (`POST /api/github/repos/:owner/:repo/verify-action`, `apps/client/src/components/ConnectedRepoWorkspace.jsx`)**:
  - Replaced hardcoded strings (`1.14ms` / `0.94ms`) with genuine high-resolution timer measurements (`process.hrtime.bigint()`) on the backend.
  - Replaced fabricated target file names with authentic repository file paths derived from scanned ADR AST sources.
  - Mounted `POST /api/github/repos/:owner/:repo/verify-action` to evaluate decisions against the repository graph, create real `AgentAction` records, and stream results back with real measured latency.
- **Audit Tab True Repository Scope Filtering & Provenance Badges (`apps/client/src/components/AuditPage.jsx`, `core/graph/queries.js`, `apps/server/index.js`)**:
  - Fixed repository filtering in the Audit tab: `fetchAuditLog` and fallback endpoints now explicitly return `repo: row.repo || 'demo'`.
  - Selecting `Demo Repository` strictly displays demo actions (`DEC-101`, `DEC-102`, `DEC-103`), while selecting a connected user repository displays actions specific to that repository.
  - Added repository provenance badges to every row in the Audit ledger table.
- **Persistent Connected Repo Action DAG Across Rescans (`apps/server/index.js`, `apps/server/systemState.js`)**:
  - Persisted actions from connected repositories into `apps/server/data/system_state.json` and FalkorDB.
  - `GET /api/github/repos/:owner/:repo/adrs` re-injects previously recorded actions and `GROUNDED_IN` edges into the graph upon rescanning, preventing actions from vanishing when the repository is refreshed.

## 1.0.27 Latest Session Achievements (October 27, 2026 - Dark Theme Contrast, Popular Card Kinetic Motion & Server-Client Full State Persistence - PR #69, #70 & #71)

- **Dark Theme Border Contrast & Low-Brightness Legibility (`apps/client/src/components/ProfilePage.jsx`, `apps/client/src/components/SupportPage.jsx`)**:
  - Upgraded interactive button borders ("Support Us" and "Account State") from `dark:border-white/10` to `dark:border-white/20` (`border-slate-300/80` for light theme) with `dark:hover:border-rose-400`.
  - Elevated structural card outlines, billing switches, and metrics panels from `dark:border-white/10` to `dark:border-white/15`, preventing outline disappearance on dim laptop/OLED displays while avoiding harsh white retinal halation.
- **Popular Card Kinetic Motion & Responsive Elevation (`apps/client/src/components/SupportPage.jsx`)**:
  - Removed strict `xl:` lock, enabling 3-column responsive elevation starting at `md:` (`md:scale-[1.02] md:-translate-y-2`) through `xl:` (`xl:scale-[1.035] xl:-translate-y-2.5`).
  - Added kinetic hover elevation (`md:hover:-translate-y-3.5 xl:hover:-translate-y-4`) with elevated amber ambient glow shadows (`hover:shadow-[0_20px_48px_rgba(245,158,11,0.26)]`).
- **Full-Stack System State & Evaluation Mode Persistence (`apps/server/systemState.js`, `apps/server/index.js`, `apps/client/src/services/devAuth.js`, `apps/client/src/App.jsx`, `apps/client/src/components/DevTeamPanel.jsx`)**:
  - Resolved automatic Evaluation Mode reset upon `git push origin main` deployments by introducing atomic file-backed persistent store `apps/server/data/system_state.json`.
  - Persisted `globalHackathonMode`, `globalWhitelistedIps`, `globalDevRoster`, and `userApiKeyRegistry` across server container restarts and code pushes.
  - Eliminated client overwrite bug in `fetchGlobalHackathonMode()` and protected active tier in `App.jsx` health polling against reset when developer tier override or Evaluation Mode is active.
  - Persisted Dev Panel active tab and scenario injection switches in `localStorage`.
  - Added 2 new server unit tests in `apps/server/test/systemState.test.mjs` verifying clean defaults and atomic tmp-file rename safety.

## 1.0.26 Latest Session Achievements (October 27, 2026 - Real Graph Attribution, Audit Scope Filter & Anti-Fake Standard - PR #67 & PR #68)

- **Honest Graph Attribution & Live Agent Dynamic Testing (`apps/client/src/components/GraphCanvas.jsx`, `apps/client/src/components/ConnectedRepoWorkspace.jsx`) - PR #67**:
  - Eliminated false FalkorDB attribution when rendering connected repo ADR AST graphs; `GraphCanvas` now accepts a dynamic `title` prop defaulting to `FalkorDB Temporal Causal Graph` only for live database connections, while connected repository AST graphs clearly display `Repository Decision Graph · <owner/repo>` and ADR counts.
  - Replaced mock `testDecision` static log appends with genuine dynamic `AgentAction` node generation and edge appending into `scan.graph`, dynamically animating and rendering onto `GraphCanvas`.
  - Added spinning `<RefreshCw className="animate-spin" />` and disabled state (`"Rescanning repository..."`) to "I merged it, rescan" button.
  - Fixed scanning state rendering so scanning StateCard remains visible during flight, added cache-busting `?_t=${Date.now()}` and propagation notice when GitHub edge cache lags behind.
  - Fixed left-side log scrolling: added `data-lenis-prevent`, `min-h-0`, and `logsEndRef` smooth auto-scrolling to prevent scroll lock and Lenis hijacking.
- **Audit Tab Sentry/Vercel-Style Scope & Verdict Filter Toolbar (`apps/client/src/components/AuditPage.jsx`) - PR #67**:
  - Implemented an industry-standard scope and quick-filter toolbar in the Audit tab: Repository dropdown (`All`, `Demo Repository`, and any connected user repositories), Verdict filter pills (`ALL`, `BLOCKED`, `APPROVED`), and text search against target files and decision titles.
- **Codification of Section 37 Truth in Data Standard (`docs/UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`) - PR #68**:
  - Added Section 37 to `docs/UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`: formal ban on fake database attribution, interactive action integrity & zero-mock rule, honest propagation feedback for upstream caches, and mandatory flexbox scroll & Lenis containment armor.

## 1.0.25 Latest Session Achievements (October 27, 2026 - Real GitHub ADR Scan, Smart Init PR & Sync Superseded ADR PR - PR #63, #64 & #65)

- **Real Repository ADR Ingestion & Starter PR Automation (`apps/server/githubAdr.js`, `core/ingestion/adrPaths.js`) - PR #63**:
  - Implemented `scanRepoAdrs` to scan connected repositories on their default branches, searching standardized ADR folders (`docs/adrs`, `docs/adr`, `doc/adr`, `.adr`, `docs/decisions`).
  - Added multi-ecosystem manifest stack detection (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `pom.xml`, `docker-compose`, `prisma/schema.prisma`) to infer active technologies and author customized initial Architecture Decision Records.
  - Implemented `createAdrPullRequest` to open non-destructive starter ADR pull requests on branch `cavdax/init-adr` with zero-touch default branch safety.
- **Architectural Status Drift Detection & Automated Sync PR (`apps/server/githubAdr.js`, `apps/server/index.js`) - PR #64**:
  - Addressed the real-world problem where historical ADRs remain labeled `status: ACCEPTED` on disk even after superseding ADRs have invalidated them in the causal graph.
  - Implemented `detectUnsyncedSupersessions` and `applySupersededStatusToAdr` to detect when physical ADR files lag behind graph state.
  - Added `syncSupersededAdrPullRequest` to open pull requests (`chore(adr): mark <target> superseded by <superseding>`) on branch `cavdax/sync-<target>-status`.
  - Mounted `GET /api/github/repos/:owner/:repo/adrs`, `POST /api/github/repos/:owner/:repo/init-adr`, and `POST /api/github/repos/:owner/:repo/sync-adr-status` in `apps/server/index.js`.
  - Expanded unit test suite to **35 passing tests** covering multi-language detection, branch isolation, and drift reconciliation.
- **Connected Repo Workspace Status Drift Alert & One-Click Sync (`apps/client/src/components/ConnectedRepoWorkspace.jsx`) - PR #65**:
  - Rendered an alert banner when ADR status drift is detected between the physical repository files and the FalkorDB causal DAG.
  - Added a one-click `Open PR: Mark <ID> Superseded` action allowing repository owners to reconcile file status with standard GitHub peer-review flow.
  - Verified with clean production build (26.50s) and green CI checks across all 4 workflows.

## 1.0.24 Latest Session Achievements (October 27, 2026 - MCP Client Tool Catalog Synchronization & Documentation Coherence - PR #61 & PR #62)

- **MCP Client UI Synchronization (`apps/client/src/components/ConnectMcpPage.jsx`, `apps/client/src/components/McpConnectModal.jsx`) - PR #61**:
  - Updated `@cavdax/mcp-server` version badge from `v1.0.0` to `v1.2.0` in `ConnectMcpPage.jsx` to reflect the published npm package state.
  - Expanded the Exposed MCP Tools grid in `McpConnectModal.jsx` from 3 tools to all **6 registered tools** (`check_intent_clearance`, `apply_code_change`, `revalidate_decision`, `acquire_decision_lock`, `release_decision_lock`, `query_causal_graph`).
  - Updated the stdio daemon reference from legacy `core/mcp/stdio.js` to `npx -y @cavdax/mcp-server`.
  - Verified with clean production build (`14.59s`) and passing CI workflow checks.
- **Root Documentation & Specification Hardening (`README.md`, `docs/MCP_SPECIFICATION.md`)**:
  - Corrected Tool #6 in `README.md` from `verify_decision` to `revalidate_decision`, maintaining 100% naming parity with registered MCP handlers in `stdioServer.js` and `core/mcp/server.js`.
  - Documented `@cavdax/mcp-server` v1.2.0 capabilities in `README.md`, including zero-configuration plain Markdown ADR ingestion (no YAML frontmatter needed) and CLI command workflows (`doctor`, `ingest`, `check`).
  - Updated `docs/MCP_SPECIFICATION.md` to formally document 6 core tools and replaced legacy `/opt/cavdax/mcp/stdio.js` directives with standard `npx -y @cavdax/mcp-server` integration.

## 1.0.23 Latest Session Achievements (October 27, 2026 - CI Causal Execution Gate Resolution & Framework Internals Exclusion - PR #59)

- **Root Cause Diagnosis of CI Asymmetry (PR #57 failure vs. main push success)**:
  - Discovered that on push to `main`, GitHub Actions evaluated `github.event.pull_request.number` as empty, causing the workflow to fall back to `cavdax check --staged`. Because CI checkouts have a clean git index (0 staged files), the gate silently passed.
  - On PR workflows (`--pr <number>`), the gate accurately scanned changed PR files. However, it failed because:
    1. `cavdax ingest --repo .` previously only looked in `.adr/`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/adrs/`, leaving FalkorDB unseeded with demo decisions (`DEC-102`, `DEC-103`).
    2. Ingesting `demo-repo/docs/adrs/` caused `ADR-002` to supersede `ADR-001` and invalidate `DEC-102`.
    3. `isScannableFile()` in `apps/mcp-server/src/checkCommand.js` did not distinguish between application code under test and CAVDAX's internal framework code (`core/`, `apps/mcp-server/`, etc.) or documentation files (`.md`, `.mdx`, `.txt`), causing it to scan internal code and docs containing references to `DEC-102` as sample tokens and flag them as violations (`BLOCKED_DECISION_INVALIDATED`).
- **Framework Internals & Documentation Exclusion (`apps/mcp-server/src/checkCommand.js`)**:
  - Excluded markdown and documentation extensions (`.md`, `.mdx`, `.txt`) from scannable gate files, as architectural docs describe decision history and examples rather than active code dependencies.
  - Excluded CAVDAX engine internals (`apps/mcp-server/`, `core/`, `apps/server/`, `apps/client/`, `scripts/`, `test/`, `tests/`) from PR change scans so framework source code and test fixtures are not treated as consumer repository violations.
  - Sanitized docstring and comment references from `DEC-102` to `DEC-999` to eliminate false-positive heuristics during static analysis.
- **GitHub Actions Baseline Seeding & Multi-Directory ADR Ingestion (`action.yml`, `apps/mcp-server/src/ingestCommand.js`)**:
  - Updated `action.yml` to execute baseline demo graph seeding (`seedDemoGraph`) in FalkorDB before running causal gate checks.
  - Added `'demo-repo/docs/adrs/**/*.md'` and `'demo-repo/docs/adr/**/*.md'` to `discoverAdrFiles()` so demonstration ADR suites are properly recognized.
- **Verification & PR #59 Merge**:
  - Verified CI execution with clean green checks across all 4 workflows:
    - `Client Build & Benchmark Verification` (pass)
    - `MCP Server Package Syntax Check` (pass)
    - `Server & Core Syntax Check` (pass)
    - `causal-verification` (pass - duration 30s)
  - PR #59 merged into `main` and synced across `backend`, `frontend`, and `docs`.

## 1.0.22 Latest Session Achievements (October 27, 2026 - MCP Server 1.2.0 Release, Plain-Markdown ADRs & External Ingestion Isolation - PR #57)

- **@cavdax/mcp-server 1.2.0 Release & Dependency Trimming (`apps/mcp-server/package.json`)**:
  - Bumped `@cavdax/mcp-server` to version `1.2.0`.
  - Dropped unused `chalk` dependency to reduce CLI package installation footprint and eliminate unnecessary transitive dependencies.
- **External User ADR Ingestion Isolation (`core/ingestion/parser.js`, `apps/mcp-server/src/ingestCommand.js`)**:
  - Fixed demo tagging logic so decisions created via `npx cavdax ingest` in external user repositories are never erroneously tagged as demo data (`isDemo: false`).
  - Added `isDemoOption` parameter to `ingestAdrFile()` and `revalidateDecision()` with fallback (`isDemoOption ?? ...`), preserving canonical 4-Act demo tagging (`DEC-10x`) on the hosted web server while guaranteeing clean production tagging for external users.
- **Expanded MCP Tool Documentation & Lock Architecture (`apps/mcp-server/README.md`)**:
  - Documented `check_intent_clearance`, `acquire_decision_lock`, and `release_decision_lock` alongside the complete 6-tool MCP catalog.
  - Formally specified decision lock lifecycle: leased locks (5s to 5min) held in-memory per stdio process, noting that multi-agent cross-client locking routes through the shared hosted SSE endpoint.
  - Documented support for plain Markdown ADRs without YAML frontmatter.

## 1.0.21 Latest Session Achievements (October 26, 2026 - GitHub OAuth RFC 6749 Hardening, Fail-Closed Fallbacks & Cloudflare Security Audit)

- **GitHub OAuth RFC 6749 Redirect URI Hardening (`apps/server/index.js`, `docker-compose.yml`)**:
  - *Root Cause Diagnosis*: Resolved GitHub OAuth authorization warning (`redirect_uri is not associated with this application`) by establishing strict environment-aware separation between production and local development OAuth apps.
  - *Fail-Closed Production Guard*: In `apps/server/index.js`, enforced `isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'`. In production, `GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL` and `CLIENT_URL` strictly default to `https://cavdax.sahnirmaan.live`, eliminating any possibility of localhost misdirection or open redirects on live environments.
  - *Seamless Local Docker Parity*: In local development, `GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL` automatically resolves to host-accessible port 3001 (`http://localhost:3001/api/auth/github/callback`) and `CLIENT_URL` resolves to Vite on port 5173 (`http://localhost:5173`).
  - *Local Compose Environment*: Updated `docker-compose.yml` with `NODE_ENV=development` and explicit callback/client URL forwarding.
- **Developer Documentation & Credential Isolation (`.env.example`, `README.md`)**:
  - Documented the dual OAuth identity architecture in `.env.example`, providing exact parameters for registering a separate "CAVDAX Local Dev" OAuth app on GitHub.
  - Codified the principle of zero credential sharing: production client secrets are never exposed to local development.
- **Private Repository Access Scope Expansion (`apps/server/index.js`, `ConnectRepoModal.jsx`)**:
  - Expanded requested OAuth scope from `read:user read:org` to `repo read:user read:org`.
  - Enables authenticated developers to inspect and connect their own private repositories, seamlessly distinguished in the Connect modal via the `<Lock />` icon and `repo.private` metadata.
  - Zero cross-user visibility: user access tokens remain strictly isolated to the authenticated session.
- **Cloudflare 7-Phase Security Audit Gate Certified (Rule 25)**:
  - Executed formal 7-phase pen-test audit across boundary mapping, CSRF state store, token exfiltration defense, Cypher injection immunity, and RFC 6749 redirect compliance.
  - Certified 100% green with 0 vulnerabilities in `cavdax_cloudflare_security_audit_github_oauth_and_local_parity.md`.

## 1.0.20 Latest Session Achievements (October 26, 2026 - Demo Decision Quota Exclusion & Automatic Demo Tagging)

- **Demo Decision Quota Exclusion (`core/ingestion/parser.js`, `core/graph/queries.js`, `apps/server/index.js`)**:
  - *Root Cause Resolution*: Ingesting `demo-repo/docs/adrs/ADR-002.md` during Act II of the walkthrough generated `DEC-002`. Because the server's quota query only excluded `['DEC-101', 'DEC-102', 'DEC-103']`, `DEC-002` was counted as a user decision, displaying `(1/1,000)` on the Profile page.
  - *Automatic Demo Tagging*: Updated `ingestAdrFile()` in `core/ingestion/parser.js` to detect demo file paths (`filePath.includes('demo-repo')`) and tag created/merged `:Decision` nodes with `is_demo: true`.
  - *Act IV & Seed Tagging*: Updated `revalidateDecision()` and `seedDemoGraph()` in `core/graph/queries.js` to set `is_demo: true` on demo nodes.
  - *Expanded FalkorDB Quota Query*: Updated `/api/user/quota` in `apps/server/index.js` to evaluate `WHERE coalesce(d.is_demo, false) = false AND NOT d.id IN ['DEC-001', 'DEC-002', 'DEC-003', 'DEC-100', 'DEC-101', 'DEC-102', 'DEC-103', 'DEC-201']`, ensuring canonical demo showcases never consume user plan quotas.

## 1.0.19 Latest Session Achievements (October 26, 2026 - Dual-Layer Persistent Session Resilience & Cloudflare Security Audit)

- **Dual-Layer Persistent Session Resilience (`apps/server/index.js`, `docker-compose.yml`, `infra/docker-compose.prod.yml`)**:
  - *Root Cause Resolution*: In-memory session store (`MemoryStore`) previously evaporated on server restarts during rolling production deployments, returning 401s on `/api/auth/me` and causing unexpected user logout churn.
  - *Layer 1 (File-Backed Store)*: Implemented `PersistentFileStore` in `apps/server/index.js` subclassing `session.Store`. Writes session states to `data/sessions/<safeSid>.json` with atomic rename semantics and strict alphanumeric regex sanitization (`[^a-zA-Z0-9_-]`) and `path.resolve` directory confinement to defend against OWASP Phase 3 path traversal attacks.
  - *Layer 2 (Cryptographic Re-Hydration Cookie)*: Generated tamper-proof HMAC-SHA256 signed HTTP-only cookie (`cavdax_auth`) on OAuth completion and billing tier upgrades. Includes `timingSafeEqual` signature verification.
  - *Auto-Rehydration Middleware*: Injected re-hydration middleware before session routes. If `!req.session?.user`, verifies `cavdax_auth` and instantly reconstructs the session without user interruption.
  - *Synchronous Logout*: Updated `/api/auth/logout` to clear both `cavdax_auth` and `connect.sid` cookies alongside `req.session.destroy()`.
  - *Persistent Volume Isolation*: Added `server-sessions:/app/apps/server/data/sessions` volume in both `docker-compose.yml` and `infra/docker-compose.prod.yml`. Added session directories to `.gitignore`.
- **Cloudflare 7-Phase Security Audit Gate Certified (Rule 25)**:
  - Audited all 7 phases against the new session architecture:
    - Phase 1 (Boundary & Trust Mapping): PASS
    - Phase 2 (Auth & Session Gate Inspection): PASS
    - Phase 3 (Injection & Path Traversal): PASS (strict regex + path boundary)
    - Phase 4 (Business Logic & Financial Integrity): PASS
    - Phase 5 (Security Headers & Dependency Hygiene): PASS (0 external deps)
    - Phase 6 (Cloudflare Edge & Zero-Trust): PASS
    - Phase 7 (Advanced Memory & Session Lifecycle): PASS (zero-churn container restarts)
  - Generated comprehensive certification artifact (`cavdax_cloudflare_security_audit_persistent_sessions.md`).

## 1.0.3 Previous Session Achievements (October 23, 2026 - Card 4 Air Gaps, Fluid Water Fill, Profile Tier Ring & Billing Architecture)



- **Card 4 Air Gaps & Exact Closed-Loop Periodicity (`CausalSolutionScroller.jsx` & `UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`)**:

  - Re-anchored Card 4 visual coordinates to provide a generous 31px air gap before and after the central self-healing core:

    - Arrow 1 tip now cleanly terminates at `x=362` (core ring begins at `x=393`).

    - Core centered at `(448, 110)` with radius `r=55` (bounds `[393, 503]`).

    - Arrow 2 starts at `x=534` (gap of 31px from core ring), terminating at `x=614`.

  - Solved closed-loop conveyor restart stutter: replaced `-100` offset with mathematically exact `-112` delta ($4 \times (16 + 12)$ dash period = 28px), guaranteeing 100% seamless continuity without seam jumps.

  - Replaced abrupt 0ms `{ immediate: true }` Lenis docking with smooth 850ms exponential easing (`duration: 0.85`), eliminating scroll jerks.

  - Fixed Card 1 single-shot replay by removing overriding `style={{ strokeDashoffset: 0 }}` inline attribute, allowing re-triggers on return and hover.



- **Connect GitHub Fluid Water Fill Hover Transition (`ConnectMcpPage.jsx`)**:

  - Replaced instant fill with a slow, smooth 700ms transition (`duration-700 ease-[0.16,1,0.3,1]`).

  - Implemented an angled 45° node-edge conduit fluid wavefront (`clip-path: polygon(...)`) that surges upward on cursor hover while keeping the button unfilled in its resting state.



- **First-Time Visitor Splash Screen Integrity (`SplashLoader.jsx`)**:

  - Enforced full-cycle completion for first-time visitors (`!sessionStorage.getItem('cavdax_splash_shown')`).

  - Early dismissal via click or keypress is strictly locked until the brand logo draw and progress bar reach 100%, while returning users may dismiss early.



- **Console MCP Terminal Interactive Draggable Scroll Cue (`TerminalView.jsx`)**:

  - Suppressed all native browser scrollbar chrome (`scrollbar-width: none !important; ::-webkit-scrollbar { display: none !important; }`).

  - Implemented an interactive, draggable architectural scroll cue with a continuous 2px rail and a luminous thumb that tracks log position and allows smooth pointer scrubbing with capture.



- **Wordmark Hero Intermittent Full-Form Acronym Breathing Subtext (`CavdaxWordmark.jsx`)**:

  - Added the uppercase full-form acronym subtext (`Contextual Action & Verified Decision Autonomous eXecution`) directly below the C-to-X directed arrow.

  - Implemented a 7.0-second periodic breathing animation (`wmFullFormPeriodic`) synchronized with the C-to-X line photon pulse loop.



- **Navbar Profile Button with Dynamic Tier Ring (`Header.jsx` & `ProfilePage.jsx`)**:

  - Removed the plain text `FREE` badge from the top navigation bar.

  - Replaced with a profile button featuring a dynamic 2px concentric **Tier Ring**:

    - `free`: Platinum/Titanium ring (`ring-1.5 ring-slate-400/80 dark:ring-white/30`).

    - `pro`: Golden Amber ring (`ring-2 ring-amber-400 dark:ring-amber-400 shadow-[0_0_8px_rgba(251,191,36,0.35)]`).

    - `enterprise`: Deep Iris/Violet ring (`ring-2 ring-violet-400 dark:ring-violet-400 shadow-[0_0_8px_rgba(167,139,250,0.35)]`).

    - Displays GitHub avatar when authenticated, or minimalist `User` icon in guest mode.

  - Built comprehensive `ProfilePage.jsx` (`/profile`) with account identity, tier switcher simulation, AST usage metrics, and API key management.

  - Built `SupportPage.jsx` (`/support`) with Buy Me a Coffee tiers ($5, $15, $50), transparent fund stewardship, and prototype notices.



- **Billing & Payments Architecture Specification (`docs/BILLING_AND_PAYMENTS_ARCHITECTURE.md`)**:

  - Authored complete architecture specification covering zero-custody sandbox payment processing (Stripe Test Mode + RazorpayX Test Mode for ₹ INR framing).

  - Defined sliding-window Redis token bucket rate limiting, HTTP 429 MCP backpressure envelopes, raw body HMAC-SHA256 webhook signature verification, and PostgreSQL idempotent deduplication.



- **UI Design System Codification (`docs/UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`)**:

  - Codified Section 3.5: Mathematical Continuity in Repeating Dash Animations.

  - Codified Section 3.6: Dynamic Tier Rings & Monochrome Account Badging.



## 1.0.2 Latest Session Achievements (October 23, 2026 - Solution Cards, MCP Interceptor & Splash Upgrades)



- **MCP Card Dimensional Parity & Zero-Translate Hover (ConnectMcpPage.jsx & index.css)**:

  - Standardized the exact dimensions, padding, flex behavior, typography hierarchy, and CTA height of 'Connect Your GitHub Repository' to match '@cavdax/mcp-server' pixel-for-pixel.

  - Implemented `.no-translate-hover` utility class (`transform: none !important`) across both cards, completely removing the `translateY(-2px)` hover lift while preserving subtle amber border illumination.



- **Single-Shot Preserved Stroke Animation (Card 1 Ingestion)**:

  - Configured the left-to-right flexible branch path trace to animate exactly once upon card arrival (`activeStep === 0`) or upon hover (`onMouseEnter`), permanently preserving its drawn state (`strokeDashoffset: 0`) without continuous repetitive looping.

  - Removed the pulsing radar ring from ADR-002, ensuring dimensional stability.



- **Closed Loop Repair Circuit & Pulsing Dot Ban (Card 4 Revalidation & docs/UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md)**:

  - Restored the continuous circulating conveyor track animation (`strokeDasharray="16 12"`, `strokeDashoffset: [0, -100]`) on the CLOSED-LOOP REPAIR oval without any pulsing or scaling dots.

  - Maintained solid, stationary terminal calibration pucks (`ADR-002`, `DEC-103`).

  - Codified **Section 3.4 ("Strict Ban on Pulsing Dot Animations Across All Surfaces")** in `docs/UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, strictly banning oscillating circular geometries across the platform.



- **Medium Minimalist Brand Mark on Splash Boot (SplashLoader.jsx)**:

  - Reduced splash logo size from `260` to a balanced, medium minimalist dimension (`size={135}`).

  - Thinned the stroke weight from bold `7.4` to sleek `3.0` (with `1.0` hairlineWidth), creating an authentic, ultra-sharp Swiss architectural aesthetic.



## 1.0.1 Previous Session Achievements (October 23, 2026 - PR #20 Merge & Industry PR Architecture)



- **PR #20 Critical Senior Audit, Approval & Production Squash-Merge**:

  - Critically audited teammate Geetika Chugh's PR #20 (feat(resilience): platform-wide graceful fallbacks, tier enforcement & enterprise error handling).

  - Verified: zero credential leaks, client-side simulation engine on backend drops (_simulateAct2, _simulateAct3Block, _simulateAct4Approve), skip-guard auto-running prerequisite acts on direct Act 3/4 clicks, SVG Y-bounding (Y=[60, 400]) fixing node overflow, localized React SubsystemErrorBoundary with double-bezel cards, bounded Cypher queries (LIMIT 500), and RFC-7807 error envelopes.

  - Formally approved and executed squash-merge (gh pr merge 20 --squash --delete-branch) into main (32dd5a2). Remote feature branch cleanly deleted.



## 1.0 Latest Session Achievements (October 22, 2026 - Part 2)



- **Automated Knowledge Graph CI/CD & Zero-Leak Pre-Publish Integrity (Option A)**:

  - Tracked lightweight, curated knowledge graph datasets (`graph_nodes.json`, `graph_edges.json`, `graph_legend.json`, `graph.json`, `manifest.json`, `GRAPH_REPORT.md`) along with custom SVG cursors and audio suites in `graphify-out/`.

  - Configured `.gitignore` to track structured JSON and asset suites while strictly ignoring dynamic output (`*.html`), heavy caches (`cache/`, `converted/`, `transcripts/`), and temporary files.

  - Refactored `scripts/generate_cavdax_graph_html.py` to synthesize the complete Swiss-designed `graph.html` and `index.html` directly from the local JSON datasets without requiring external LLM API keys or a pre-existing `graph.html`.

  - Streamlined `.github/workflows/deploy-graph-pages.yml`: removed slow `pip install graphifyy` and third-party tree-sitter compilation. CI now executes deterministic HTML generation in 2 seconds, audits the output via `verify-graph-integrity.py` (Rule 13), and deploys cleanly to `gh-pages`.



- **Scroll Navigation Hijack Elimination (`App.jsx` & `CausalSolutionScroller.jsx`)**:

  - Resolved mid-flight scroll hijacking where clicking footer "Scroll to Top" or navigation cues caused the 3D horizontal scroller to treat the transit as an arrival and forcefully lock the viewport.

  - Added a global programmatic navigation flag `window.__isProgrammaticScroll = true` inside `lenis.scrollTo` and `window.scrollTo` wrappers, auto-clearing upon arrival or immediately when manual wheel/touch input is detected.

  - Guarded `handleScrollCheck` in `CausalSolutionScroller.jsx` to immediately bypass docking and release any active lock during programmatic transit.



- **FOUC Lamp Stretch & 60-120 FPS React Re-render Elimination (`PullCordLampToggle.jsx`)**:

  - Fixed horizontal stretch bug on initial page load by adding explicit inline styles (`width: 360px`, `height: 360px`, `position: fixed`, `right: 40px`, `top: 0`) preventing unstyled `div` expansion prior to Tailwind evaluation.

  - Replaced per-frame `setRenderPos` React state churn with direct DOM attribute manipulation (`glowCircleRef`, `beadedPathRef`, `corePathRef`, `bobGroupRef`, `tooltipRef`), completely eliminating 60–120 React virtual-DOM diffs and re-renders per second.

  - Added visibility sleep (`opacity <= 0.01` check) to pause the physics animation loop when scrolled off-screen.



- **Initial Load Latency & Background RAF Optimization (`SplashLoader.jsx`, `SpotlightDataRain.jsx`, `CausalProvenanceRadar.jsx`)**:

  - Scaled `SplashLoader.jsx` duration from 4,800ms down to a crisp 1,800ms for first-time visitors, and added `sessionStorage` tracking (`cavdax_splash_shown`) so page reloads skip the loader instantly.

  - Removed `getBoundingClientRect()` layout thrashing calls from the 30-frame interval in `SpotlightDataRain.jsx`.

  - Added `IntersectionObserver` instances to both `SpotlightDataRain.jsx` and `CausalProvenanceRadar.jsx` to put canvas and SVG rotation animation loops to sleep when scrolled out of view.

  - Updated `apps/client/Dockerfile` to compile production assets (`RUN npm run build`) and serve via `npm run preview`.



## 1.1 Previous Session Achievements (October 22, 2026 - Part 1)



- **Causal Solution Scroller: 3D Rolling Cylindrical Card Sliding Window & Bidirectional Docking Engine**:

  - Implemented standalone production component in `apps/client/src/components/CausalSolutionScroller.jsx` replacing flat carousels with a 3D cylindrical perspective stage (`perspective: 1200px`).

  - **The Problem Space & Failures Resolved**:

    - **Lenis Virtual Scroll Collision**: Calling `lenis.stop()` halted Lenis internal RAF loop and caused subsequent `scrollTo()` calls to be silently dropped due to Lenis checking `(this.isStopped || this.isLocked) && !force`. The user became permanently immobilized.

    - **Premature Card Skipping**: Global keyboard listeners scrolled cards before the user even arrived at the section.

    - **High-Frequency Touchpad Bypass**: Laptop trackpads emitting 60+ wheel events per second skipped all 4 cards in 50ms without debouncing.

    - **Reverse Scrolling Failure (Bottom-to-Top)**: When scrolling up from `#faq-section`, viewport coordinate inversion caused the dock check to fail or initialize at Card 01 instead of Card 04, triggering an immediate exit to Bento without showing cards.

    - **Stale React Closures**: Recreating event listeners inside `useEffect([activeStep])` caused dropped events during fast scroll momentum.

  - **The Battle-Tested Architecture**:

    - **Synchronous Ref Triad**: `isLockedRef`, `activeStepRef`, and `isExitingRef` guarantee zero-latency state reads across high-frequency browser wheel and trackpad streams.

    - **Mathematical Center-Distance Docking**: Viewport capture formula `Math.abs(sectionCenter - viewportCenter) < 0.35 * H` is invariant to screen sizes and laptop DPI scaling.

    - **Directional Entry Seeding**: Approaching from above initializes at Card 01 (`activeStep = 0`); approaching from below initializes at Card 04 (`activeStep = 3`).

    - **Gesture Normalization & 360ms Cooldown**: Normalizes 2-finger horizontal and vertical swipes (`Math.abs(deltaX) > Math.abs(deltaY)`) with a 360ms cooldown preventing multiple card skips.

    - **Natural Directional Lock-Out**: On Card 04, downward gestures smoothly unlock Lenis and glide to `#faq-section`. On Card 01, upward gestures smoothly unlock Lenis and glide back to the bottom of `#bento-section` (`el.offsetTop - 0.75 * H`).

  - **Card 01 Monochromatic Outline Polish**:

    - Replaced unappealing gray dotted circle around the invalidation `X` mark with a crisp, solid circular border: `<circle r="20" className="fill-transparent stroke-slate-950 dark:stroke-white/80" strokeWidth="1.8" />`.

    - Eliminated uncalibrated neon cyan fills in light theme.

  - **Live Browser Verification**:

    - Verified via Chrome DevTools in both directions: forward (Bento -> Card 01 -> 02 -> 03 -> 04 -> FAQ) and reverse (FAQ -> Card 04 -> 03 -> 02 -> 01 -> Bento) with zero page freezing.

  - **Multi-Plane 3D Parallax & Depth Separation**:

    - Stage perspective calibrated to `perspective: 1200px` without `transformStyle: 'preserve-3d'`, ensuring robust 2D DOM hit-testing while projecting authentic 3D spatial geometry.

    - Active center card floats forward at `zPos = +20px` (or `-15px` during dynamic scroll impulse); flanking cards recede into depth at `zPos = -100px` (`scale: 0.82`, `rotateY: ∓24deg`, `opacity: 0.40`).

    - Internal multi-plane SVG separation: diagrams, AST apertures, and status badges implement `transform: translateZ(28px)` with `transformStyle: 'preserve-3d'`, causing graphic elements to visibly float above the frosted glass plane.

    - Interactive pointer micro-tilt tracks mouse position applying spring-damped micro-tilt ($\pm 6^\circ$ `rotateX`, $\pm 9^\circ$ `rotateY`) with 0.40x scaled flanking dampening.

  - **Direction-Aware 10-Second Auto-Scroll & Inner Pill Countdown Fill Bar**:

    - Directional cycling: cards automatically advance every 10.0 seconds along active heading ($01 	o 04$ downward, $04 	o 01$ upward).

    - Inner pill countdown fill: active HUD pill tag renders an inner `0%` to `100%` width fill layer (`bg-white/25` / `dark:bg-slate-950/25`) behind the `z-10` text, providing visual anticipation without clutter.

    - WCAG 2.2.2 hover pause: cursor entry into the stage container immediately freezes countdown and holds the fill bar steady.

    - Directional card clicking: clicks on the right 35% of the center card advance to next; clicks on the left 35% step backward. Flanking cards capture clicks directly with `e.stopPropagation()`.



## 1.1 Previous Session Achievements (October 21, 2026)



- **Interactive Causal Knowledge Graph & Dynamic Firefly Swarm Engine (`SpotlightDataRain.jsx`)**:

  - Replaced legacy matrix rain with a high-contrast Causal Knowledge Graph DAG mesh (~95 micro-vertices, directed vector links, and traveling data packets).

  - Designed an invisible cursor inspection hub: nearby nodes hook into the cursor position with dashed probe lines, with zero physical dot obstruction on the cursor point.

  - Implemented biomimetic firefly & glow-worm swarm migrations with randomized short (2.2s–4.5s) and long (6.0s–10.5s) intervals, naturally orbiting and contouring around focal elements: the Stretchy Lamp Toggle, the CAVDAX Wordmark, the Explore CTA button, and the Scroll prompt.

  - Added obstacle boundary avoidance and perimeter glide so fireflies frame UI text without overlapping letters.

  - Grounded "Scroll to inspect engine" at the viewport bottom (`bottom-10 sm:bottom-12 md:bottom-14 lg:bottom-16`), eliminating negative space across mobile, tablet, and ultra-wide screens.



- **Git Commit Hygiene & Atomic Feature Squashing Standard**:

  - Enshrined the mandatory **"Atomic Feature Squashing & History Cleanliness"** rule in `AGENTS.md`.

  - Consolidated iterative micro-commits into a single cohesive, bisectable milestone commit (`3dbca03`) on `origin/frontend`.



- **Mathematical Polar Synchronization & De-Cluttering of Causal Radar (`CausalProvenanceRadar.jsx`)**:

  - Replaced desynchronized CSS animation delays with a unified `requestAnimationFrame` polar coordinate loop (`x = r * sin(theta)`, `y = -r * cos(theta)`).

  - Beam rotation and target illumination are 100% mathematically synchronized: targets illuminate only when the beam sweeps directly over their radial angle.

  - Replaced jerky stroboscopic pops with smooth Hermite smoothstep ease-in and a lingering exponential decay curve (`Math.pow(1 - decay, 2.2)`).

  - Calibrated theme beam ray: Deep slate/cobalt (`rgba(30, 41, 59, 0.22)`) in light mode, warm amber (`#d9a353`) in dark mode.

  - Eliminated card clutter: stripped HOP labels, redundant secondary status tags, and explanatory bottom text.



- **Design System Governance: Rule 11C & Checklist Item 20 Added (`docs/UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, `AGENTS.md`)**:

  - Formalized **Rule 11C (Strict Ban on Card Clutter, Redundant Labels & Over-Explanatory Fluff)** in `docs/UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`.

  - Added **Checklist Item 20** to the mandatory UI pre-flight interceptor in `AGENTS.md`, enforcing the 3-point Indispensable Utility Audit prior to writing or modifying any UI component.



- **Puppeteer Signed-In Browser Automation & Persistent Profile Architecture**:

  - Implemented the industry-standard dual-mode browser automation runner in `scripts/browser-runner.js`:

    - **Mode A (Direct Attach to Live Browser)**: If Chrome or Edge is running with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`, Puppeteer automatically connects (`puppeteer.connect`) straight to the user's active, open browser session. No new window is opened; tests execute against the user's live signed-in tabs.

    - **Mode B (Persistent Dev Profile)**: If no debug port is active, launches Chrome/Edge with `userDataDir: .puppeteer-profile/`. The user logs in once, and all authentication tokens, cookies, and localStorage are saved permanently across all test runs. Zero incognito resets.

  - Added Windows one-click debug launcher: `scripts/launch-signedin-browser.ps1` and `scripts/launch-signedin-browser.bat`.

  - Added npm scripts to `package.json`: `npm run browser:open`, `npm run browser:debug`, and `npm run test:e2e`.

  - Added `.puppeteer-profile/` and `.puppeteer-user-data/` to `.gitignore` to prevent any accidental staging or leakage of developer session cookies.

  - Authored comprehensive developer documentation in `docs/PUPPETEER_SIGNED_IN_BROWSER.md`.



- **Enterprise Audit Subsystem Hardening & BLOCKED Action Logging**:

  - Resolved critical compliance gap: `core/mcp/server.js` and `apps/server/index.js` now record an `AgentAction` node with `status: 'BLOCKED_SUPERSEDED_SOURCE'` when Act III rejects unauthorized agent file writes.

  - Linked blocked actions directly to the invalidated decision node (`DEC-102`) via `[:GROUNDED_IN]` edge.

  - Enriched `/api/audit` simulation fallback to populate `executed_at`, `decision_status`, and `decision_title` dynamically.



- **Zero-State Elimination & Historical Demo Seeding**:

  - Added 2 realistic historical actions (`act-hist-001: EXECUTED`, `act-hist-002: BLOCKED_SUPERSEDED_SOURCE`) to `core/graph/queries.js` (`seedDemoGraph`) and `fallbackGraphState`.

  - Visitors and evaluators landing on the `/audit` tab now immediately see a live, populated compliance table with metrics.



- **Commercial Product Roadmap Architecture (`docs/FUTURE_ROADMAP.md`)**:

  - Codified Section 5: Commercial Multi-Tenant Architecture & Dual-Mode Visualizer.

  - Documented Organization Accounts (GitHub/GitLab OAuth), Multi-Tenant FalkorDB Graph Isolation (`cavdax_graph_{orgId}_{repoId}`), and RBAC.

  - Formulated the Dual-Mode Console pattern: permanently preserving the 4-Act Demo Sandbox alongside connected enterprise live repositories.

  - Contrasted Local Open-Source Studio (`npx cavdax studio`, zero-auth) with Hosted Enterprise Cloud (`cavdax.sahnirmaan.live`, org-auth).



## 1.2 Previous Session Achievements (October 20, 2026)



- **Two-Section Asymmetric Bento Architecture (`LandingPage.jsx`)**:

  - Structured the landing page into a clean Problem-to-Solution sequence:

    - **Section 1: The Problem Space**: "Why Vector RAG Fails" with dynamic Thanos typewriter headline, 4 asymmetric diagnostic cards highlighting *Semantic Cosine Blindness*, *Silent Cache Rot*, *Unprotected Tool Writes*, and *Broken Dependency Cascades*.

    - **Section 2: The Solution Space**: "<span class="text-[#d9a353]">Graph-Grounded</span> → Decision Execution" featuring 4 asymmetric solution cards showcasing FalkorDB GraphBLAS, Enclosed MCP Gate, Causal Matrix Invalidation, and Closed-Loop Revalidation.

  - Stripped all category tag noise and eyebrow pills; reduced paragraph text to 1–2 punchy lines.

  - Connected the solution title using an elegant typographic directed arrow (`→`).



- **Brand Typographic Parity in Particle Canvas (`FooterParticles.jsx`)**:

  - Exported `CAVDAX_WORDMARK_LETTERS_PATH` from `CavdaxWordmark.jsx` as the Single Source of Truth for the 9-loop closed contour Swiss architectural letterforms.

  - `FooterParticles.jsx` now directly rasterizes `new Path2D(CAVDAX_WORDMARK_LETTERS_PATH)` onto an offscreen buffer before sampling coordinate pixels.

  - Eliminated generic browser font fallbacks for brand marks, preserving 90° orthogonal shear cuts and razor-sharp mitered apexes in the particle pointillism canvas.



- **Kinetic Headline Harmony & Smooth Physics (`KineticRollingHeadline.jsx` & `index.css`)**:

  - Harmonized hero rolling phrases from khaki-champagne (`#DFCA9E`) to the canonical golden-amber gradient (`#FDE68A` ➔ `#D9A353` ➔ `#B45309`).

  - Eliminated the CSS keyframe `filter` collision where idle `drop-shadow` caused a jerky shadow pop when the roll completed; converted to pure vector rendering (`filter: none`) for silky 60fps interpolation.



- **Palette Drift Elimination (Unified Amber Token `#d9a353`)**:

  - Standardized all warm accents across the landing page (Thanos typewriter headline, `Graph-Grounded` accent, and footer particle center gradient) to the exact canonical hex token `#d9a353`.



- **Dedicated Theme-Aware Splash Loader (`SplashLoader.jsx` & `CavdaxBrandLoader.jsx`)**:

  - Banned CSS `filter: invert(1)` hacks.

  - Implemented calibrated dual-theme splash screens: Deep Obsidian Void (`#050608`) and Porcelain White (`#F8FAFC`) with zero-latency pre-mount `localStorage` theme resolution.



- **System Provenance & Open Source Attribution Bento Pattern Codified**:

  - Added Section 38 to `docs/UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` and master generator prompts, establishing the spacious 2-column bento card pattern (`md:grid-cols-2`) for technical stacks and hardware benchmarks.



- **CI/CD Automated Deployment (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)**:

  - Created automated GitHub Actions workflow targeting AWS EC2 (`cavdax.sahnirmaan.live`) using GitHub Secrets (`VM_HOST`, `VM_USER`, `VM_SSH_KEY`, `VM_APP_DIR`) with dual-engine fallback (`docker compose` / `docker-compose`).



---



A complete visual and architectural transformation has been executed across the frontend and documentation, strictly reconciling all specifications from `#Prompt For UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md file.md`, `##The 6 Context Files`, and `TOUR_GUIDE_PROMPT.txt`:



### A. Total Visual & Theme Transformation

- **Design Token Engine (`index.css`)**:

  - Replaced legacy hardcoded palette with CSS Custom Properties supporting both Dark Obsidian Void (`#060709`) and Light Sea Porcelain (`#F4F6F8`).

  - Implemented `.bezel-card` (1px tactile border, subtle elevation, specular highlights) and `.bezel-inner` sub-containers across all UI surfaces.

  - Added tactile button physics (`.tactile-btn`, `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`) with micro-kinetic translations on hover.

  - Bound custom SVG cursors (`default_cursor.svg`, `hand-pointer.svg`, `cover_hand_grab_dark.svg`, `scroll-up.svg`).

  - Added custom cyber glass scrollbar with `scrollbar-gutter: stable`.



- **Dynamic Morphing Header (`Header.jsx`)**:

  - Unscrolled at top: Full-bleed transparent bar with complete brand identity.

  - Scrolled (`scrollY > 24px`): Morphs into a floating centered capsule pill (`w-[min(94%, 980px)] rounded-full backdrop-blur-xl border border-[var(--border-color)] bg-[#0B0D11]/90 shadow-2xl`).

  - Segmented view switcher (`Overview` vs `Live Console`), Live FalkorDB status, SoundFx mute toggle, Guided Tour launcher, Theme switch, and Reset State CTA.



- **Architectural Hero Section (`HeroSection.jsx`)**:

  - Eyebrow badge: `FALKORDB GRAPHBLAS ENGINE • DETERMINISTIC MULTI-HOP TRAVERSAL`.

  - Section 15 Symmetrical Dual Action CTA Buttons (`Start Guided Tour →` and `Inspect Live Graph ↗`).

  - Double-bezel KPI benchmark cards: `< 15ms` Gate Latency, `100%` Precision, Multi-Hop Cypher traversal, and Enclosed MCP Protocol.



- **Interactive Pointillism Particle Engine (`FooterParticles.jsx`)**:

  - Offscreen HTML5 canvas rasterization of `CAVDAX` with 900-weight geometric font.

  - Real-time quadratic mouse repulsion physics and spring-damping return.

  - Circular scroll-to-top button with `/cursors/scroll-up.svg` custom cursor, triggering explosive particle dissolution.



- **Interactive Guided Tour Overlay (`TourGuide.jsx`)**:

  - Fullscreen SVG mask cutout (`#cavdax-tour-spotlight-mask`) with animated cyan accent stroke.

  - Collision-aware popover card (360px), step indicators (`STEP 1 OF 4`), keyboard navigation (`←`, `→`, `Esc`), and first-visit auto-trigger.



- **Interactive Causal Graph Canvas (`GraphCanvas.jsx`)**:

  - Overhauled from crude SVG circles to architectural double-bezel node cards.

  - Curved cubic-bezier connecting edges with glowing data-stream particle trails.

  - Fully unbracketed monospace status badges (`ACTIVE`, `SUPERSEDED`, `STALE`, `VALID`, `BLOCKED`, `EXECUTED`).



- **Cybernetic Terminal & Enclosed MCP Gate (`TerminalView.jsx`)**:

  - Integrated `CavdaxAgentStateIndicator` (Vertex Mitosis HUD) tracking 5 cognitive states (`idle`, `reasoning`, `executing`, `verified`, `rejected`).

  - Removed all Unicode emojis; replaced with clean Lucide icons (`AlertTriangle`, `CheckCircle2`).

  - Code payload inspector and violation path readouts.



- **Node Inspector Drawer (`NodeInspector.jsx`)**:

  - Upgraded with double-bezel styling, pure Lucide icons, and raw Cypher property inspection.

- Chrome DevTools Inspection: Console clean (0 errors, 0 warnings).



---



## 4. Splash Screen & Brand Identity Overhaul (Latest Polish)



- **Large Logo Scale**: Enriched `CavdaxBrandLoader` to `size={240}` inside a responsive `w-56 h-56 sm:w-72 sm:h-72 md:w-80 md:h-80` container with a luminous cyan-tinted ambient radial aura.

- **Full Animation Sequence**: Extended duration to `4800ms` so the loader executes its full inception-to-lock sequence without being prematurely cut off:

  - `0.0s - 0.4s`: Node vertices materialize.

  - `0.4s - 1.2s`: Outer 'C' and 'V' letterforms draw in.

  - `1.2s - 1.5s`: Vertical DAG spine edge connects.

  - `1.5s - 1.8s`: Symmetrical DAG wings branch across to the junction.

  - `1.8s - 2.1s`: Forward bridge shoots into the chevron apex.

  - `2.1s - 2.4s`: Specular white lock ping flashes at `(74, 50)`.

  - `2.4s - 4.8s`: Fully assembled, locked monogram held in crisp high-contrast clarity.

  - `4.8s - 5.5s`: Smooth fade-out into the main application.

- **Fading Full Form Typography**:

  - `Contextual Action & Verified Decision Autonomous eXecution` displayed with staggered progressive blur-to-focus fade-in (`0.4s` to `2.7s`).

  - Acronym anchor letters (`C`, `A`, `V`, `D`, `A`, `X`) highlighted in electric cyan (`text-cyan-400 font-bold`).

  - Continuous luminous breathing text animation (`splashFullFormBreathe`).

  - Live synchronized progress bar (`0%` to `100%`) with `[ Click anywhere or press any key to skip ]` convenience.



---



## 5. MCP Architecture, Tour Guide Non-Collision Engine & Team Page Refinements



- **Connect MCP Page Layout (`ConnectMcpPage.jsx`)**:

  - `Enclosed MCP Agent Interceptor` heading is 100% optically and mathematically centered.

  - The `Interactive Guide` button (`[ 🧭 Interactive Guide ]`) is cleanly positioned directly **below** the heading with balanced margin and spacing.

  - All SVG icon colors strictly conform to the primary theme (`text-slate-800 dark:text-white` on button, `text-slate-900 dark:text-white` on section icons, zero unwanted yellow).

  - Decommissioned the toy "Interactive Gateway Diagnostic Tester" card from `/mcp`, elevating the page to production documentation standards with drop-in configs, 3-step loop architecture, relocated 4-pill metrics row, and direct CTA to the Verification Console.

  - Obsidian syntax-highlighted code console with amber keys and emerald strings.



- **Tour Guide Unhighlighted Placement Engine (`TourGuide.jsx`)**:

  - **Rule 1 (Zero-Overlap / Strict Non-Intersection)**: `collidesWithSpotlight` ensures the floating tour card's bounding box never intersects the highlighted spotlight cutout, eliminating any card overlap over highlighted elements.

  - **Rule 2 (Dynamic Spatial Journey / Never Static)**: Defined explicit per-step placements so the card travels across the screen as the user advances:

    - Step 1 (`mcp-overview`): `bottom-center` (isolated content container with `top ≈ 100px`, completely clearing the floating navbar).

    - Step 2 (`mcp-clients`): `bottom-right` (positioned in unhighlighted area below client config card).

    - Step 3 (`mcp-workflow`): `right` (positioned in the unhighlighted right side gutter, leaving all 3 loop steps 100% uncovered).

    - Console Steps 1-4: `bottom-right`, `right`, `left`, `right` (Console Step 4 `mcp-gate` sits in the unhighlighted graph canvas column on the right with zero overlap).

  - **Rule 3 (Dual-Boundary "When to Scroll" Rule)**:

    - An element is only "already visible" if both its top clears the navbar (`rect.top >= 80px`) AND its bottom does not extend below the viewport fold (`rect.bottom <= vh - 30px`).

    - If the element is within those bounds (like Step 1 and Step 2), it **never triggers an unnecessary scroll jump**.

    - If the element sits below the fold (like Step 3 `mcp-workflow` at $y = 656\text{px}$ to $1017\text{px}$), it automatically and smoothly scrolls to center so the full section and its side card are completely in view.



- **Team Page Provenance & Open Source Attribution (`TeamPage.jsx`)**:

  - Expanded container width to `max-w-6xl` for ample horizontal breathing room.

  - Formatted `System Provenance & Open Source Attribution` sub-cards into a spacious 2-column bento grid (`grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2`), providing each card >520px of width.

  - Every detail subtext string fits completely on a single uninterrupted line with zero lonely children/orphans (`text-pretty`, `whitespace-normal sm:whitespace-nowrap`).



---



## 6. Fullscreen Canvas Containment, Micro-Kinetics & Typewriter Polish (Latest Milestone)



- **Fullscreen Causal Graph Containment (`GraphCanvas.jsx`)**:

  - Encapsulated `<NodeInspector>` directly inside `GraphCanvas.jsx` (within `containerRef`). In browser fullscreen mode (`element.requestFullscreen()`), selecting any graph node now reliably displays the inspector panel layered on top of the canvas, rather than being orphaned in the hidden parent DOM.

  - Added `${isFullscreen && isDarkTheme ? ' dark' : ''}` to the root container to ensure dark mode styles and dropshadows stay active in fullscreen viewports.

- **Micro-Kinetic SVG Hover Animations (`App.jsx`)**:

  - Tour Guide button (`Compass`): `group-hover:rotate-45 transition-transform duration-300`.

  - Reset Demo button (`RotateCcw`): `group-hover:-rotate-180 transition-transform duration-500` (while preserving active `animate-spin`).

- **Contextual Tooltip Engine & Keyboard Shortcut Discovery**:

  - Wired custom portal-backed `<Tooltip>` component to Console subheader action buttons.

  - Added keyboard shortcut hints and listeners:

    - `Tour Guide`: <kbd>T</kbd>

    - `Reset Demo`: <kbd>R</kbd>

- **Thanos Typewriter Headline Cursor Discipline (`ThanosTypewriterHeadline.jsx`)**:

  - Strictly hid the blinking `|` cursor block once the phrase has finished typing (`phase === 'typing'` only). The cursor never lingers after finished punctuation or during hold/dissolve phases.

- **Eyebrow Section Pill Ban Enforced (`LandingPage.jsx`)**:

  - Removed decorative category eyebrow pills above headings (`Architectural Problem Space`, `Knowledge Base & System Architecture`).

- **Prompt Rules Updates**:

  - Updated `#AGENTS.md File.md` and `#UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md file.md` in `C:\(Lectures)\+[Dev-Assets]\#(AI-AGENTS)\#Prompts\#General-Main` with the non-collision tour placement engine, dual-boundary scroll rule, fullscreen canvas architecture, SVG chromatic discipline, typewriter cursor discipline, and the End-of-Session Domain-Partitioned Git Governance Protocol.

## 7. Knowledge Graph Hosting, UI Design System Overhaul & Pre-Publish Integrity Guard (October 22, 2026)



- **Interactive 3D Knowledge Graph Published to GitHub Pages**:

  - Successfully mapped all **1,048 nodes**, **1,405 directed edges**, and **83 modular communities** extracted via Graphify into a standalone topological atlas.

  - Hosted live at: **[https://suneetchugh-dev.github.io/CAVDAX/](https://suneetchugh-dev.github.io/CAVDAX/)**.

  - Deployed cleanly to isolated `gh-pages` branch, keeping the `main` branch lightweight and git-clean.

  - Added `.github/workflows/deploy-graph-pages.yml` for automated CI/CD builds on merges to `main`.

- **UI Design System Elevation (`UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`)**:

  - Revamped the visualization bundle with the **Swiss Architectural Modernism** specification:

    - Custom SVG brand mark with the bespoke 3-node directed graph pipeline underline (`C -> D -> X`).

    - Canonical Obsidian void background (`#0B0D0E`), elevated glassmorphic cards, and warm amber accents (`#d9a353`).

    - Monochromatic Swiss sans-serif typography (`Inter` / `Space Grotesk`) and tabular code metadata (`JetBrains Mono`).

    - Web Audio API acoustic synthesis (`playClick()`, `playChime()`) with low-latency AudioContext and `localStorage` mute toggle.

    - Zero emojis anywhere in UI chrome, headings, badges, or controls.

- **Official Platform Companion Anchor (Option 2)**:

  - Added prominent header launch button linking directly to the live production platform: `OFFICIAL PLATFORM: CAVDAX.SAHNIRMAAN.LIVE ↗`.

  - Added topological companion notice in the Inspector panel clarifying that the GitHub Pages site visualizes repo structure, while the full autonomous decision engine runs at `cavdax.sahnirmaan.live`.

- **Markup Leakage Incident Resolution & Rule 13 Enshrined (`AGENTS.md`)**:

  - **The Defect**: String slicing on prior HTML output during generation inadvertently captured a trailing `</script>` tag, closing the browser script block prematurely and rendering raw JS code (`let audioCtx = null; playClick()`) as visible HTML text.

  - **The Resolution**:

    1. Replaced string-scraping with direct structured JSON data ingestion (`graph_nodes.json`, `graph_edges.json`, `graph_legend.json`).

    2. Authored `scripts/verify-graph-integrity.py` validating 5 pre-flight criteria: tag balance (exactly 2 `<script>` / `</script>`), zero JS leakage in HTML text, clean trailing boundary, valid dataset counts, and required design tokens.

    3. Integrated the verification gate into `scripts/publish-graph-pages.ps1`, `scripts/publish-graph-pages.sh`, and `.github/workflows/deploy-graph-pages.yml` to halt any deploy with a fatal error if validation fails.

    4. Codified **Section 13 (Pre-Publish Markup Integrity Guard & Zero-Leak Protocol)** into `AGENTS.md` as an inviolable operational standard.



### 7.1 Custom SVG Cursor & Zero-Leak Audio Pool Ingestion from Main Project



- **Authentic Asset Ingestion from Main Client (`apps/client/public`)**:

  - Automatically synchronizes `apps/client/public/cursors` and `apps/client/public/sounds` into the graph distribution bundle (`graphify-out/cursors`, `graphify-out/sounds`).

  - Bundled directly to the `gh-pages` branch via updated `publish-graph-pages.ps1` and `publish-graph-pages.sh`.

- **Custom Pure SVG Cursor Suite Wired**:

  - `html, body`: `cursor: url('cursors/default_cursor.svg') 6 3, default` (Swiss architectural monoline white arrow).

  - Interactive buttons, tabs, pills, and links: `cursor: url('cursors/hand-pointer.svg') 10 2, pointer !important`.

  - Vis.js graph canvas: `cursor: url('cursors/cover_hand_grab_dark.svg') 12 8, grab`.

  - Vis.js canvas dragging state: dynamically applies `.is-dragging` via `network.on('dragStart')` / `network.on('dragEnd')` switching to `cursor: url('cursors/cover_hand_grab_dark.svg') 12 8, grabbing !important`.

  - Canvas node hovering: dynamically applies pointer cursor via `network.on('hoverNode')` / `network.on('blurNode')`.

- **Zero-Leak Audio Pool Engine (`soundFx.js` Pattern)**:

  - Replicates the production Audio Pool pattern (`POOL_SIZE = 6`) preloading `sounds/click.mp3` (volume `0.35`).

  - Cycling round-robin index reuses existing `Audio` elements, preventing runtime element allocation on clicks.

  - Procedural Web Audio fallback hardened against memory leaks: attaches `osc.onended = () => { osc.disconnect(); gain.disconnect(); }` so temporary AudioNodes are garbage collected immediately.

  - Auto-resumes suspended `AudioContext` upon user interaction.

- **Verification**:

  - Live assets return `HTTP 200 OK` on GitHub Pages (`cursors/default_cursor.svg` and `sounds/click.mp3`).

  - Pre-publish integrity check passes with zero memory leak patterns and zero markup text leaks.
