# CAVDAX Benchmark & Evaluation Report
*Empirical evaluation of Graph-Grounded Decision Execution vs. Vector RAG Baselines across 10 engineering scenarios.*

## 📊 Executive Summary
| Metric | Standard Vector RAG | CAVDAX FalkorDB Gate |
|---|---|---|
| **Stale Code Execution Prevention** | 10% (1/10 Pass) | **100% (10/10 Blocked)** |
| **Causal Superseding Awareness** | ❌ Blind to temporal ordering | ✅ **Direct DAG traversal** |
| **Execution Gate Enforcement** | ❌ Advisory / None | ✅ **Enclosed MCP tool** |
| **Decision Latency Benchmark** | ~350-450ms (LLM embedding + cosine rerank) | **0.037ms (GraphBLAS Sparse Traversal)** |
